========== NEW COLOR WEIGHTING ALGORITHM ==========

add RPG type effects popping up based on how the color algo went. Like if the offset is really low, show 'critical hit!' etc.
    hue critical hit, saturation critical hit, value critical hit, combos, all 3, etc

add chance for "super white" or "super black" special pixels to appear. special hex code, drawn as gradients on the canvas and in history. have a high/low value with low saturation to greatly weigh the average
